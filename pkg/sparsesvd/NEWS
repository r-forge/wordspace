Version 0.2-2:

  - change unsafe sprintf() to snprintf() as demanded by CRAN (though entirely unjustified, as DRH would tell them in no uncertain terms)
  - omit SVDLIBC file I/O functionality (where sprintf() occurred) entirely as it is not needed by R wrapper

Version 0.2-1:

  - adapted to avoid deprecated format conversions in Matrix v1.4-2
  - sparsesvd() now supports wider range of Matrix input formats, but requires Matrix >= 1.3
  - fix incorrect gender of package maintainer

Version 0.2:

  - this release fixes several bugs in the underlying 3rd-party SVDLIBC code, which produce incorrect results or get stuck in infinite loops for highly sparse matrices that require multiple restarts of the Lanczos iteration; various corner cases including small diagonal matrices were also affected
  - a faulty RNG implementation in SVDLIBC contributed to triggering these bugs (but was not the root cause); the RNG has also been fixed
  - original bug report from Abdelmoneim Desouki <desouki@hhu.de>

Version 0.1-4:

  - for some inexplicable reason, R on Oracle Solaris 10 (i386) doesn't like C functions named "store", leading to a segmentation fault and test failures on CRAN
  - function store() has been renamed store_vec() in the 3rd-party C code included in the package

Version 0.1-3:

  - added native routine registration to comply with new CRAN requirements

Version 0.1-2:

  - stress tests with large number of random sparse nonnegative matrices
  - fix some typos in documentation

Version 0.1-1:

  - fix ISO C incompatibilities that prevented compilation on some platforms
  - more detailed copyright information in DESCRIPTION and LICENSE

Version 0.1:

  - initial release
  - based on SVDLIBC version 1.4
  - modified to avoid I/O on STDOUT and STDERR
